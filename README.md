# Tic Tac Toe

A javascript implementation of the popular tic-tac-toe 2D game. This project is hosted at [https://x-tic-tac-o.herokuapp.com](https://x-tic-tac-o.herokuapp.com)

## The Dream

This is a description of the goal of this project. It includes Game Play and Design.

#### Game Play

- A tic-tac-toe board game with sizes between 3 and 10
- The game should be playable on every javascript-enabled browser
- Network Play between Humans should be enabled via Web Sockets
- Bots should come in three levels - Learner, Master and Grand Master
    - Learner bots should be trivial to beat
    - Master bots should be difficult to beat
    - Grand Master bots should be impossible to beat
- Bots should learn from previous games and get better with each played game
- The game should know when there are no ore possible moves and declare the result

#### Design

- The board should fit on every screen in all its sizes (desktop, mobile and tablet)
- The design should be: 
    - easy on the eyes
    - engaging
